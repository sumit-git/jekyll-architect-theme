Dr. A Velumani founded Thyrocare over a decade ago. Since its inception, Thyrocare Technologies Limited has been one of the most popular laboratory chains in India. Spread across 2000+ towns in India and abroad, Thyrocare claims to process more than 40,000 specimens and more than 2,00,000 clinical chemistry investigations everyday. Its mission is to ensure that the right value is given in the right time to the right patient, and with this it aims to meet 50% of the diagnostic needs of 50% of the world's population at 50% of the costs.

Thyrocare believes that ‘Quality’ is the heart of any intelligent management. It is one of India’s first diagnostic labs to achieve internationally acclaimed quality accreditations such as ISO 9001-2000 rating as early as 2001, which is now escalated to ISO 9001:2008; NABL (National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories) in 2005 and CAP (College of American Pathologists) certification in 2007. 

Thyrocare’s focus is on providing high-quality investigative studies at an affordable cost. It achieves this with a centralised processing laboratory (CPL) in Mumbai for esoteric tests and regional processing laboratory in major metro cities. Accuracy and affordability is also enhanced by Thyrocare’s ability to empower itself with state-of-the art technologies, brands and systems. Thyrocare facilities include an IT enabled, 24x7, fully automated diagnostic laboratory set up covering over 2,00,000 sq. ft. floor space. Some of the cutting-edge technologies available at Thyrocare include chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA), enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), capillary electrophoresis, Ion selective electrode, fluorescence flow cytometry, nephelometry, photometry, liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometry and cytogenetics. Thyrocare subsidiary, called Nueclear, provides PET-CT scan at most metros in India.

At Thyrocare, online bookings are made available for a wide range of tests. Thyrocare collects almost all the samples through franchisees spread across the country. Thyrocare offers home-collection facility and considers 8 am to 11 am as the ideal time for sample collection, unless otherwise recommended by your doctor. Thyrocare strives to innovate and remain at par with global standards by providing world-class service delivery at very competitive prices. In India, Thyrocare is the first and one of the most advanced totally automated laboratories. Over the years since its inception, Thyrocare has upgraded itself to 100% barcoded system with bi-directional interface and complete automation. All the samples collected are packed and shipped with a triple-packing system as per WHO-IATA guidelines.
